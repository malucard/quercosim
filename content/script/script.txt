dm Ah, hello Ambassador Alba and Protagonist, yes, I am the Foot Professor Deid Mann.
pose querco normal
qa Ah, fine afternoon, Professor Mann. In fact, we have here a manuscript from the late Robert Parkman. It's very interesting.
dm Hmm. Is it?
pose querco think
qa I'll read it to you. ‚ÄòAccording to the Encyclopedia Britannica, the foot is the longest, strongest part of the human body.‚Äô
qa ‚ÄòThe strongest structures of the foot are the tarsals, the ankle bones, and the toes. The foot's most important function is to help you move: to stand on it, to walk, to run, to jump.‚Äô
dm Well, that's a very interesting thing. It's certainly true.
pose querco hand
qa It's not the fact that it's accurate, Professor Deid Mann, but the sheer force of what he said about the foot.
dm It is true. It is, then, no wonder that I set out, as others before me, to investigate its secret. And the secret of the foot -- the foot that defines us -- is an ability to grasp the secrets of the universe. It's the most incredible thing.
dm Because the foot has the capacity for phenomenal power, as well as emotional depth. It is a mysterious, mysterious place. A place of power, and with every day that goes by, the power of the foot increases. It is inside us, always.
dm Now, I must be on my way, sirs. I have a ways to go in writing my essay.

			ob Actually, uhh, I just happened to find him for the second time now. He must have, uh, gotten busy again after before.
			ob I guess I was a bit, uh... irrational back there. Mr. Alba had to go to his country for, uh, important reasons.
			ob On instinct, I tried to keep him, using my position. But that's... cruel.
			ob Letting him go... uhh, that might have been the right decision, in the end.

			pr Obama-san, you're the President of the United States, yeah? Why are you still here at Allebahst Academy? Weren't you just visiting?
			ob Well, have you thought about, uhh, the diplomatic purpose of this institution?
			pr Diplomatic purpose?
			ob I mean, come on, it's, uhh... a college institution situated in an embassy, and it's owned by Allebahst. And we, uh, also have Babahl Academy over there, owned by Babahl. And all of that is in, uh, the United States of America.
			ob You know what that means, right?
			pr It means... Alba-san is here sometimes.
			ob It's not, uh, a regular college at all. The three countries use the building to keep, uh, diplomatic relations between each other.
			ob In fact, I oversaw the construction of this place myself.
			ob I had, uhh, official meetings here, and so did Mr. Alba.
			ob However, as I am the President, I have to stay here, uh, for much longer. I am needed for many occasions.
			pr Don't you have the rest of the country to take care of?
			ob I, uh... I do, but you underestimate the importance of this building. I have handled, uh, several different matters today.
			pr (It was kinda busy today, now that I think of it.)
			ob Also, uh, the White House is right nearby, so it's really not much of an issue for me.
			ob Mr. Alba, however, uhh, he works here at the embassy, but I heard something's happening in his country. I guess it makes sense that he, uh, had to go to Allebahst, even though he has to fly, uh, so far.
			pr I see.
