fl It is enough to be a student here. In my little corner, there is NOTHING else to think about. There are no peers to taunt me, there is no mother to shame me... NOTHING! All I have is my studies.
fl I am not forced to die of starvation, nor is my body forced to cave in. All I have is the knowledge that I am more beautiful than everyone around me, and that is enough.
pr fucking boring, i didnt ask for your tragic life story anyway
fl Nothing is boring when you consider it in the WORST of conditions. I can recite your vocabulary backwards, and recite my feelings for you forward. The flower of a flower is boring to the gardener.

th You can tell where this is going, right? One question we have to answer to determine which one is a string and which one is a tube is, "What does this do?" Another important question is, "Is it a string?"
th A complicated equation is solved by passing the ends of the string between our lips. Now we have to pull. One hand on the string, the other hand on the body of the instrument

Then how do you decide if you are regular or silly? Well there are really a two methods of defining the idea.\nFirstly, strap or tie up the wakeboard bindings then they suit you snugly and make sure you are comfortable with whichever walk you‚Äôre putting forth. Standing with the right foot forward is a normal attitude, while holding the left foot ahead is called a silly attitude. If you are uncomfortable with this position that bindings are putting you in, unfasten and adjust them before proceeding. Place yourself in some point from the boat, but not up to now that the circle is already drawn directly. Let the wakeboard lie sideways, half submerged under water, and go into the squat position with your knees just about the chest. Rest the arms flat before you on either side of the knees and grip the hold of the tow circle.\nIn Havana, this response to man obama‚Äôs gambit is mixed.

pose protagonist snap
pr I know... To take the fork elevator outside, the culprit--
penalty_choice "incinerated it" "elevated it across the fence" elevated "dated it" dated "stabbed it" stabbed "covered it" covered

cp But, a vehicle of that size...? That... might not be possible.
cp It would take a looooong time to incinerate everything. Plus, there's plastic and rubber and fuel and shit, it would be nasty, to say the least. Could kill people.
pr Maybe they did it anyway. Y'know, just risk it, they would hate to get caught, right? So.
pr Who cares if a few more people die. In fact, if the culprit isn't Holmes-san, it might actually help them get away.
pose colias grin
cp ...Look, if it were anything like that at all, we *really* would know, unless we died. It would be full and incinerating right now, too, but we know it isn't even running. also it's too small

label elevated
pr The culprit used a fork elevator to elevate the fork elevator and bring it across the fence!
cp ...That... doesn't explain anything.
pose colias grin
cp Even if something like that happened, how did they take the other one outside?
pr They uh, used the one that's outside to take the one that's inside outside!
pose protagonist serious
pr That's totally possible, right?? Look at those holey fences!
pose colias normal
cp No, that's not physically possible. They can't reach either low or high enough. Come on
penalty
pr (Ugh...)

label dated
pr The culprit took the fork elevator out on a date!
pr Together, they romantically escaped by jumping the fence to live a happy life, and were never seen again!
cp Sorry Protagonist, this is real life, you have to make a little bit of sense

label stabbed
pr The culprit stabbed the fork elevator with the murderous knife so it would go away!
cp ...What?
pr Uh... See...
pr Don't penalize me. There's definitely a way for them to do this.
cp Then. How exactly did they do this?
pr There was a way they could have stabbed it and completed their plan.

label choice
pr To get the fork elevator to go away, they stabbed...
penalty_choice "the wheel" "the pedal" pedal "the tank" tank

pr If the culprit stabbed the wheel, it would be able to drive itself or something!
cp Oh? What about the pedal?
cp Well I mean, even if you taped it down or something, it would just crash on a wall, so idk
pr (That... doesn't solve it, I guess. Dammit.)
penalty
pr (Surely there's a more complete solution.)
goto <choice

label pedal
pr If the culprit stabbed the pedal, it would be able to accelerate itself at maximum velocity, thus sending it forward fast and crashing anywhere without a human driver to care about!
pr Maybe it could go so fast that it went flying over the fence, eliminating that problem!
cp ...It can't go that fast, unfortunately, it's just a fork elevator. Not even cars can do that.
pr (Dammit, so close...)

cp There's an unaffected area. Clearly, this is from the fork elevator. Maybe one of the wheels or something.
cp This... tells us the exact position that it was in when it was still on the floor and leaking. It also tells us how much of the oil leaked to what directions.
cp Knowing the principle that the rain lifts the vehicle more where there's more oil...
cp By using it to plot a line...
