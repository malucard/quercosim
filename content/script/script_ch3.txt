? Ah...
? (What a weird dream...)
? (I wake up a little startled. I don't feel like sleeping more...)
? (I look out the window - I can barely see the sun. It's started to come out, but the rainy clouds mask it.)

? (Right, we don't have class today. The professor was killed, and the investigation isn't done.)
? (That's what I'm going to do today. Everyone meets up at the White House, then we go to the airport.)
? (...For some reason, I get a weird feeling...)
? (I get up, and walk over to the light switch...)
? (I flip it, and look in the mirror.)
