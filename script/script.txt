Rules: idk man just fuck my shit up and make it as funny and dating sim-like as possible
The game will have alot of routes and i want everyone (as the guy who’ll put everything in the engine) to write (and also edit if necessary) the game and choices you’ll take that lead to other routes
There’ll also be confession cross examinations and make them like confessions where a character tells the {anon’s () abode} player or another character their confession on why they hate them but they’re all a lie because they love them :flushed:
make sure you do "[character name]: [something something]" to make it obvious who's talking
Currently the characters are: protagonist, Quercus Alba, obama, Deid Mann and L’Belle (there’ll be more when you guys suggest and agree on them)
Also if you want to make it obvious that characters will be having speech bubbles just say things like for example [X character’s objection] and stuff like that

Anyways, let’s begin now
