"This is an investigation. But, that's boring, right?" "How so?" "Let's make it a date."

a timer ticks down as their seductiometer continually lowers (maybe yours too? could be strategic) "Wow, you're boring. Who'd ever be interested in someone like this?" "Your logic is... not so hot anymore. Frankly, step up your game."
"But for them to take me seriously, I will need to [h]seduce[/h] them."
g [center]Object of Seduction - Why did Deid Mann vent?[/center]
Conclusion 1 - Brought there
Correction 1 - Suspected something
Object of Seduction - Why did the impostor kill?
(colias twist)
It looked like Colias had left his things in a hurry, and is confirmed he was there shortly before body found, maybe timestamp on something
Conclusion 2 - Afraid of being caught
Correction 2 - Premeditated
Object of Seduction - Who committed the murder?
come up with a premeditated motive
Conclusion 3 - Colias Palaeno
Correction 3 - Sus imposter

show all the conclusions, then all the corrections
have a while between each object of seduction and conclusions and corrections; we are solving a large chunk of the case, so we need to make it a significant part of the chapter
perceive-like point out where the problem is


IDEA: Have a "goal" on investigations in general, relating to this

There has been a [h]murder around us[/h].

It seems it is as we feared... There is an [h]impostor among us[/h].
